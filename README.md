# Surfs Up!

# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS:
The purpose of this analysis is to utilize Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, to filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the months of June and December. I will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

## DELIVERABLE 1:
Determine the Summary Statistics for June 
I downloaded the started code and renamed it. I used the provided instructions to add code as indicated by numbered comments in the starter code file. I wrote a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperature for the month of June. Next, I converted the June temperatures to a list.  I followed that by creating a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of June. Then, I generated the summary statistics for the June temperature DataFrame. Lastly, I ran the SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb file, confirmed that the summary statistics match the image provided.
